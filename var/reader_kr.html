			<p>100 Million Years Button and Prison of Time [1] – part 1</p><p>Allen Rodore. 15 years old.</p><p>I… did not have the talent for the sword. To the point where I felt pathetic.</p><p>Nevertheless, I kept swinging the sword day in and day out.</p><p>I single-mindedly kept swinging the sword many times more than anyone else, and much longer than anyone else.</p><p>Because my mother always said ーー 『Effort will surely bear fruit』.</p><p>Mother raised me all on her own.</p><p>My father seems to have died of an epidemic when I was a baby. I heard that he was a sincere and honest person, but I don’t even remember his face thus I wasn’t attached to him. It seems that I got my sharp eyes from my mother and the pitch black hair from my father.</p><p>I don’t remember much from my childhood, but I remembered that my mother worked herself to the bone everyday for my sake.</p><p>The enrollment fee and tuition fee of the Gran Swordsmanship Academy I am attending now, are the wages my mom saved and managed carefully year after year.</p><p>So even if I was scorned as the 「Failed Swordsman」 at the academy, even when I was bullied by my classmates, even when I was treated as a burden by my teacher – I kept swinging my sword every day, no matter how painful.</p><p>I will put in ten fold the amount of effort more than anyone and become a splendid swordsman.</p><p>And I will give an easy life to my mother who has struggled so far.</p><p>ーWith that in mind, I’ve been doing my best at the Swordsmanship Academy.</p><p>All that effort will be for naught come tomorrow.</p><p>The trigger was … today at dusk.</p><p>While I was swinging the sword alone in the schoolyard as usual, Dodriel Barton appeared accompanied by two girls.</p><p>Dodriel Barton.</p><p>The eldest son of the House of Baron Barton, with his conspicuous blue hair trailing behind his back.</p><p>I abhor this guy.</p><p>Because he always scorned me as 「Failed Swordsman」and bullied me.</p><p>Usually I would pretend not to hear and pass off his snide remarks.</p><p>Today however, he said something I absolutely couldn’t forgive.</p><div align="center" id="lightnovelpub_incontent_1" class="adsbox" data-freestar-ad="__336x280 __300x250"><script data-cfasync="false" type="text/javascript">freestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: "lightnovelpub_incontent_1", slotId: "lightnovelpub_incontent_1" });</script></div><p>「Take back your words…!」</p><p>「Oi oi… Don’t get so angry over the truth, Allen. If the child is trash, then the parent must also be trash, right? There is nothing weird about that…」</p><p>「Dodriel, you…!」</p><p>I got enraged and grabbed onto his collars.</p><p>「Tch… how dare you touch me with your filthy hands! You lowly failed swordsman!」</p><p>He kicked me in the stomach.</p><p><i><strong>The source of this chapter is lightno&zwj;velpub.c&#8203;om</strong></i></p><p>Despite being a child as well, I was blown away due to the difference in our strength.</p><p>I disgracefully fell on my butt, but immediately stood back up and scowled at him.</p><p>「I certainly might be a talentless trash…. But I won’t let you call my mother trash!」</p><p>Dodriel shrugged his shoulders and sighed.</p><p>The two girls laughed at me while I shouted.</p><p>「Hah… A frog’s child is called a frog, right? Of course the parent of trash like you is trash too. It has been decided so since a long ago」</p><p>Dodriel ridiculed as though feeling pity for me from the bottom of his heart.</p><p>「Y-You…!」</p><p>With the blood running to my head, I pulled out the sword fastened at my hips.</p><p>「Oi Oi, are you sure? Anymore than that would be a violation of the academy rules, you know?」</p><p>「Tch…」</p><p>Private battle using swords between students are prohibited by academy rules.</p><p>Breaking this will result in severe penalties such as suspension or expulsion.</p><p>If I, who am at the bottom of this academy were to do this … I’ll definitely be expelled.</p><p>「…Then! Dodriel Barton… I challenge you to a duel!」</p><p>「Heh… The eternal failed swordsman against the highest genius swordsman of this academy…?」</p><p>「Yeah! If I win, you will take back those words from before!」</p><div align="center" id="lightnovelpub_incontent_2" class="adsbox" data-freestar-ad="__336x280 __300x250"><script data-cfasync="false" type="text/javascript">freestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: "lightnovelpub_incontent_2", slotId: "lightnovelpub_incontent_2" });</script></div><p>「Aha! Amusing… how amusing, Allen! If you were to win, I will take back my words from before! I’ll even bow my head or anything else you want! ーhowever, if you were to lose-」</p><p>He cut off his words there, and his lips curled into repulsive smirk.</p><p>「…If I were to lose?」</p><p>「Let’s see… you must quit this academy on the spot」</p><p>「Wha-!?」</p><p>The condition that Dodriel proposed was preposterous.</p><p>「Obviously… In a duel, both parties have to face off on equal terms. Don’t you know that?」</p><p>「Yeah! I know! But this is unbalanced! 」</p><p>On one hand, withdrawal of remarks and on the other, dropping out of academy.</p><p>These aren’t equal terms.</p><p>「Oi oi, don’t misunderstand, Failed Swordsman-san? You dropping out of academy doesn’t hold that much value. Or more precisely, you yourself don’t hold that much value in the first place?」</p><p>「……」</p><p><i><strong>Visit lightno&#8203;velpub.c&#8204;om for a better reading experience</strong></i></p><p>It’s frustrating but… it is as he says.</p><p>My grades at the Swordsmanship Academy were the lowest by a huge margin.</p><p>It’s a situation where I don’t know when I’ll be forced to quit due to poor grades.</p><p>「Understood… I accept the duel on those terms」</p><p>「Ooh, I accept your challenge! Time is tomorrow morning at 9. How about having it at the gymnasium?」</p><p>I gave a slight nod.</p><p>「I will take care of applying for the duel. Allen, at the very least struggle desperately to make it seem like a duel. Although, it obviously will be a waste of effort. Ahahahahahahah!」</p><p>Thus, I was to duel the Genius Swordsman tomorrow.</p><p>Thinking about it now, what a foolish thing I have done.</p><p>(No… but, if he were to say the same thing again, I would challenge him to a duel all the same)</p><p>I’m not rotten to the point where I ignore the ridicules towards my mother.</p><div align="center" id="lightnovelpub_incontent_3" class="adsbox" data-freestar-ad="__336x280 __300x250"><script data-cfasync="false" type="text/javascript">freestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: "lightnovelpub_incontent_3", slotId: "lightnovelpub_incontent_3" });</script></div><p>(But… Dodriel is strong)</p><p>He is the exact opposite of me ー a genius type.</p><p>Even though he hasn’t practiced much, he immediately absorbs any type of swordsmanship as his own like a sponge.</p><p>Rumour has it that he enrolled into the academy with a referral from a prestigious school in the capital…</p><p>(Even so… I definitely can’t lose…)</p><p>My dropping out of this academy hinges on this duel.</p><p>Above all, he must withdraw the snide remarks towards my mother.</p><p>After that, I returned to my dorm, and then headed to the forest with a sword in one hand.</p><p>I arrived at the place where I always practice swinging, and kept swinging my sword wholeheartedly.</p><p>「Fuh, Fuh, Fuh…!」</p><p>I continued swinging my sword recklessly and desperately.</p><p>It’s not that I had become desperate.</p><p>But rather, this was all I could do.</p><p>When I first entered, I bowed down to various teachers at the Academy of Swordsmanship and asked them to take me under their wing.</p><p>However…,</p><p>「Unfortunately, you don’t have talent. You can’t survive through my training」</p><p>「Oi Oi Oi! You sure run your mouth saying 『Make me your disciple』with such a feeble sword like this!」</p><p>「Do you know of the phrase… 『Know your place』?」</p><p><i><strong>Visit lightno&#8205;velpub.c&shy;om for a better reading experience</strong></i></p><p>All of them flatly refused.</p><p>I had nothing to hang on to.</p><p>That is why, I don’t know the styles of sword, let alone the techniques.</p><p>The only thing I was taught in the academy classes was how to swing the sword and how to train the body.</p><p>In other words, the only thing I can do as 『training』 is to swing my sword fully.</p><div align="center" id="lightnovelpub_incontent_4" class="adsbox" data-freestar-ad="__336x280 __300x250"><script data-cfasync="false" type="text/javascript">freestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: "lightnovelpub_incontent_4", slotId: "lightnovelpub_incontent_4" });</script></div><p>After that, when the sun went down and the moonlight shined on me- I finally stopped swinging my sword.</p><p>「Ha, haha, hahahahaha…!」</p><p>Laughter spontaneously overflowed from my mouth.</p><p>「How foolish.. I was…! There is no way I can win by doing this…!」</p><p>Swinging the sword frantically has no meaning at all.</p><p>No matter what, I’m going to lose tomorrow anyway. It would be a tragic sight.</p><p>The gap between me and that guy, can’t be closed in a single day.</p><p>Even several years will not be enough to catch up.</p><p>(Frustrating……. frustrating frustrating frustrating… frustrating!)</p><p>It’s frustrating, but… no matter how many times I run the simulation in my mind, I can’t come up with a vision that wins against that genius.</p><p>「Just what… should I do…」</p><p>It was so frustrating that… my tears overflowed.</p><p>I want power.</p><p>The power to defeat Dodriel.</p><p>However, I don’t have enough of anything.</p><p>Power, talent, and above all else, time…</p><p>「……goddamnit!」</p><p>And right when I punched the ground.</p><p>「Ho Ho Ho……. you seem to be at a loss, young swordsman.」</p><p>Suddenly, I heard a hoarse voice from overhead.</p><p>「Wh-Who are you!?」</p><p>When I panicked and looked up, a short old man was standing there.</p><p>His hair, eyebrows, and beard were all pure white.</p><div align="center" id="lightnovelpub_incontent_5" class="adsbox" data-freestar-ad="__336x280 __300x250"><script data-cfasync="false" type="text/javascript">freestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: "lightnovelpub_incontent_5", slotId: "lightnovelpub_incontent_5" });</script></div><p>The waist was also clearly bent and he had a cane in one hand.</p><p><i><strong>The latest episodes are on the lightno&#8206;velpub.c&#8206;om website.</strong></i></p><p>But the most ominous part of it all, I didn’t sense his presence.</p><p>「Me? I am something of a… hermit of time.」</p>
